# Math 107 Elementary Statistics

The world is experiencing a flood of data. Everywhere we look—from our cell phones to our Amazon shopping carts—data are being collected. Often, these data only give a partial picture of the phenomenon of interest, so we must be able to learn from data in order to make objective decisions in the presence of uncertainty. This course aims to help you develop the tools to think with and about data in order to be informed citizens in a data-centric world. More specifically, this course will cover graphical and analytical tools to conduct data analysis essential for gaining knowledge in almost any field.
