<p>The world is experiencing a flood of data. Everywhere we look—from our cell phones to our Amazon shopping carts—data are being collected. Often, these data only give a partial picture of the phenomenon of interest, so we must be able to learn from data in order to make objective decisions in the presence of uncertainty. This course aims to help you develop the tools to think with and about data in order to be informed citizens in a data-centric world. More specifically, this course will cover graphical and analytical tools to conduct data analysis essential for gaining knowledge in almost any field.</p>

<p>After finishing this course, you should have:

<ul>
<li> An understanding of the importance of data collection, the ability to recognize limitations in data collection methods, and an awareness of the role that data collection plays in determining the scope of inference.</li>
<li> The ability to use technology to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform straightfor- ward data analysis procedures.</li>
<li> A solid conceptual understanding of key concepts such as the logic of statistical inference, estimation with intervals, and testing for significance.</li>
<li> The knowledge of which statistical methods to use in which situations, the technological expertise to use the appropriate method(s), and the understanding necessary to interpret the results correctly, effectively, and in context.</li>
<li> The ability to understand and think critically about data-based claims.</li>
<li> An awareness of the power of data.</li>
</ul>
</p>
